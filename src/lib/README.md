# README for src/lib directory

Subdirectories here (will eventually) store code that is specific to a certain feature or aspect of the system. Examples include the action plan, assessments and the docbuilder. The intention is to encapsulate as much of these things into their own "modules" as possible to keep the system relatively organized and aid in decoupling. This will also aid in making things more portable and removable should the need arise.

It's unlikely we'll have everything perfectly encapsulated, but it'll be an improvement. This is a long-term refactoring goal, not something that's ready to go as of this writing.

As we move things here, we'll be actively working to establish a standardized file structure.
